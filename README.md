# IGF1_project
DO project

This project was formed to see if there was any relationship between IGF-1 and lifespan in DO mice.

Halfway through, new data was provided which is why the shock data survival analysis.R has different files than the other four scripts. If you are going to use that script, find the new files from the other scripts.
